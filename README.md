# EIP2771 using ethers.js

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
Enabled with EIP712 for better expierience with off chain signing
Use _msgSender() instead of msg.sender to enable meta transactions and let your friends pay for your transactions

```shell
npm install
```
to install all dependencies
